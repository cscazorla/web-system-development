                The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the
                Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which
                communicate all together.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#History" target="_blank">
                  The history of the Internet is somewhat obscure.

                    public infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public universities
                    and private companies.

                    The various technologies that support the Internet have evolved over time, but
                    the way it works hasn't changed that much: Internet is a way to connect
                    computers all together and ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to
                    stay connected.

            <p>
              When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically
              (usually with an
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable" target="_blank">
                Ethernet cable
              </a>
              ) or wirelessly (for example with
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi" target="_blank">Wi-Fi</a>
              or
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth" target="_blank">Bluetooth</a>
              systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.

            <ul>
              <li>
                To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny
                computer called a network
                <strong>switch</strong>
                (or switch for short).
              </li>
              <li>
                This switch has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure
                that messages sent from a given computer arrive only at their target destination
                computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once we add a switch to the system, our network of 10 computers only requires 10
                cables: a single plug for each computer and a switch with 10 plugs.
              </li>

                So far so good. But what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of
                computers?
              </li>
              <li>
                Of course a single switch can't scale that far, but, if you read carefully, we said
                that a switch is a computer like any other, so what keeps us from connecting two
                switches together? Nothing, so let's do that.

                  The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to

                  An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together
                  and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is

            <h1>Finding computers</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one.</li>
              <li>
                Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it,
                called an "IP address" (where IP stands for Internet Protocol).
              </li>
              <li>
                It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example:
                192.0.2.172.
              </li>
              <li>
                That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time
                remembering that sort of address.
              </li>
              <li>
                To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human-readable name called
                a domain name.

            <h1>What is a web server?</h1>
            <p>
              The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working
              together.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On the
                <strong>hardware</strong>
                side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's
                component
                <strong>files</strong>
                . A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with
                other devices connected to the web.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the
                <strong>software</strong>
                side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted
                files.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    At a minimum, this is an
                    <strong>HTTP</strong>
                    server. An HTTP server is software that understands
                    <strong>URLs</strong>
                    (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An HTTP server can be accessed through the
                    <strong>domain names</strong>
                    of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites
                    to the end user's device.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h1>Requesting a file via HTTP</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests
                the file via
                <strong>HTTP</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP
                server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the
                browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested document, it
                returns a 404 response instead.)
              </li>
            </ul>

                It is a

                protocol, meaning that the client sends a request to the server and the server sends
                a response back.

                HTTP is an application layer protocol that is sent over

                , or over a
                <strong>TLS-encrypted</strong>

                Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also

              </li>
              <li>
                HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

            <h1>The problem with testing local files</h1>
            <p>
              Some examples won't run if you open them as local files. This can be due to a variety
              of reasons, the most likely being:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They feature
                <strong>asynchronous requests:</strong>
                Some browsers (including Chrome) will not run async requests (see Learn: Making
                network requests with JavaScript) if you just run the example from a local file.
                This is because of security restrictions (for more on web security, read Website
                security).
              </li>
              <li>
                They feature a
                <strong>server-side language:</strong>
                Server-side languages (such as PHP or Python) require a special server to interpret
                the code and deliver the results.
              </li>
              <li>
                They
                <strong>include other files:</strong>
                Browsers commonly treat requests to load resources using the file:// schema as
                cross-origin requests. So if you load a local file that includes other local files,
                this may trigger a
                <strong>CORS</strong>
                error.

              of your content to be displayed.

                For example, you might mark some particular run of text as a paragraph with this
                <strong>HTML</strong>
                :
              </p>
              <pre>

            </div>
            <div class="fragment fade-in">
              <p>
                Then, you can set the size and color of that paragraph with some
                <strong>CSS</strong>
                :
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code data-trim class="language-css">
                  p {
                    font-size: 20px;
                    color: blue;

            <div class="fragment fade-in">
              <p>
                And, if you want to get fancy, you can re-write that paragraph when the user clicks
                it with some
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>
              </p>
              <pre>

                As you can see, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are totally different languages, but they
                all refer to one another in some way. Most websites rely on all three, but the
                appearance of every website is determined by HTML and CSS.

            <ul>
              <li>
                First, we need to tell browsers that this is an
                <strong>HTML5</strong>
                web page with the
                <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>
                line. This is just a special string that browsers look for when they try to display
                our web page, and it always needs to look exactly like it does above.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, our entire web page needs to be wrapped in
                <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                tags.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The actual
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    text is called an ‚Äúopening tag‚Äù, while
                    <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                    is called a ‚Äúclosing tag‚Äù.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Everything inside of these tags are considered part of the
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    ‚Äúelement‚Äù, which is this ethereal thing that gets created when a web browser
                    parses your HTML tags.
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Head and Body</h1>
            <div
              style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; gap: 2em"
            >
              <div>
                <p>
                  Inside of the
                  <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                  element, we have two more elements called
                  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                  and
                  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                  . A web page's head contains all of its metadata, like the page title, any CSS
                  stylesheets, and other things that are required to render the page but you don't
                  necessarily want the user to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bulk of our HTML markup will live in the
                  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                  element, which represents the visible content of the page. Note that opening up
                  our page in a web browser wont display anything, since it has an empty
                  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                  .
                </p>
              </div>
              <img
                style="width: 40%"

            </div>
            <p>
              The purpose of this
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
              /
              <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
              split will become clearer in a few chapters after we start working with CSS.

                Notice the HTML comment syntax in the above snippet. Anything that starts with
                <code>&lt;!--</code>
                and ends with
                <code>--&gt;</code>
                will be completely ignored by the browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                HTML comments are used to leave notes in your code that won't be seen by the
                browser.
              </li>

            <h1>Page Titles</h1>
            <p>
              One of the most important pieces of metadata is the title of your web page, defined by
              the aptly named
              <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
              element. Browsers display this in the tab for your page, and Google displays it in
              search engine results.

            <h1>Nested Elements</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Notice how all the HTML tags in our web page are neatly
                <strong>nested</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>It's very important to ensure that there are no overlapping elements.</li>
              <li>
                For instance, the
                <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
                element is supposed to be inside of the
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                , so you'd never want to add the closing
                <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
                tag before the closing
                <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                tag.
              </li>

          <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
          <p>
            Titles are all well and good, but let‚Äôs do something we can actually see. The
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
            element marks all the text inside it as a distinct paragraph. Try adding the following
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
            element to the body of our web page:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code data-trim class="language-html">
              <script type="text/template">
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                  <head>
                    <title>My First Web Page</title>
                  </head>
                  <body>
                    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
                  </body>
                </html>
              </script>
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Also note how the
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
            and
            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
            elements are indented twice, while
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
            and
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
            are indented once. Indenting nested elements like this is an important best practice
            that makes your HTML easier to read for other developers (or for yourself if you come
            back 5 months from now and want to change some stuff).

          <h1>Headings</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Headings are the primary way you mark up different sections of your content. They
              define the
              <strong>outline</strong>
              of your web page as
              <strong>both humans and search engines see it</strong>
              , which makes selecting relevant headings essential for a high-quality web page.
            </li>
            <li>Headings are like titles, but they‚Äôre actually displayed on the page.</li>
            <li>
              HTML provides six levels of headings, and the corresponding elements are:
              <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
              ,
              <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
              ,
              <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
              , ‚Ä¶ ,
              <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>
              .
            </li>
            <li>The higher the number, the less prominent the heading.</li>
            <li>By default, browsers render less important headings in smaller fonts.</li>

                Whenever you surround a piece of text with HTML tags, you‚Äôre adding new meaning to

                Wrapping content in

              </li>
              <li>
                To denote individual items in that list, you wrap them in

            <p>
              The HTML specification defines strict rules about what elements can go inside other
              elements. In this case,
              <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
              elements should only contain
              <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
              elements, which means you should never ever write something like this:
            </p>

              <code data-trim class="language-html">

            <p>
              Instead, you should wrap that paragraph with

            <h1>Block-Level vs. Inline Elements</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                So far, we've only been working with ‚Äúblock-level elements‚Äù (also called ‚Äúflow
                content‚Äù).
              </li>
              <li>
                The other major type of content is ‚Äúinline elements‚Äù or ‚Äúphrasing content‚Äù, which
                are treated a little bit differently.
              </li>
              <li>
                Block-level elements are always drawn on a new line, while inline elements can
                affect sections of text anywhere within a line.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Emphasis (Italic) Elements</h1>
            <p>
              For instance,
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
              is a block-level element, while
              <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
              is an inline element that affects a span of text
              <em>inside</em>
              of a paragraph. It stands for ‚Äúemphasis‚Äù, and it's typically displayed as italicized
              text.

              If you want to be more emphatic than an
              <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
              tag, you can use
              <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>
              . It's an inline element just like
              <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
              , and looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code data-trim class="language-html">
                <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance

            <h1>Structure vs Presentation</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You might be wondering why we‚Äôre using the terms ‚Äúemphasis‚Äù and ‚Äústrong‚Äù instead of
                ‚Äúitalic‚Äù and ‚Äúbold‚Äù.
              </li>
              <li>That brings us to an important distinction between HTML and CSS.</li>
              <li>
                HTML markup should provide
                <strong>semantic</strong>
                information about your content‚Äînot
                <strong>presentational</strong>
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                In other words, HTML should define the structure of your document, leaving its
                appearance to CSS.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img

          <section>
            <h1>
              Why do we use
              <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
              and
              <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>
              ?
            </h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The pseudo-obsolete
                <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
                and
                <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
                elements are classic examples of this.
              </li>
              <li>
                They used to stand for ‚Äúbold‚Äù and ‚Äúitalic‚Äù, respectively, but HTML5 attempted to
                create a clear separation between a document‚Äôs structure and its presentation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thus,
                <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
                was replaced with
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
                , since emphasized text can be displayed in all sorts of ways aside from being
                italicized (e.g., in a different font, a different color, or a bigger size). Same
                for
                <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
                and
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>
                .

            <h1>Empty HTML Elements</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The HTML tags we've encountered so far either wrap text content (e.g.,
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                ) or other HTML elements (e.g.,
                <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
                ).
              </li>
              <li>
                That's not the case for all HTML elements. Some of them can be ‚Äúempty‚Äú or
                ‚Äúself-closing‚Äù.
              </li>
              <li>
                Line breaks and horizontal rules are the most common empty elements you'll find.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Line Breaks</h1>
            <p>
              HTML condenses consecutive spaces, tabs, or newlines (together known as ‚Äúwhitespace‚Äù)
              into a single space.
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code data-trim class="language-html">
                <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

              The newline after
              <code>Regards</code>
              in the above snippet will be transformed into a space instead of displaying as a line
              break

            <h1>Add a Line Break</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This behavior may seem counter intuitive, but web developers often set their text
                editor to limit line length to around 80 characters.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a programmer, it's easier to manage code this way, but having each of the
                newlines show up in the rendered page would severely mess up the intended page
                layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                To tell the browser that we want a
                <strong>hard line break</strong>
                , we need to use an explicit
                <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>
                element.

              <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>
              tag. Each one you use should still convey
              <em>meaning</em>
              ‚Äîyou shouldn't use it to, say, add a bunch of space between paragraphs:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code data-trim class="language-html">
                <!-- You shouldn't do this -->

            <p>
              This kind of presentational information should be defined in your

            <ul>
              <li>
                Links are created with the
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                element, which stands for ‚Äúanchor‚Äù.
              </li>
              <li>
                It works just like all the elements in the previous chapter: when you wrap some text
                in
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                tags, it alters the meaning of that content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let's take a look by adding the following paragraph to the
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                element of
                <code>links.html</code>
                :
              </li>
            </ul>
            <pre style="margin-bottom: 5em">
              <code data-trim class="language-html">
                <p>This example is about links and <a>images</a>.</p>
              </code>
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li>
                However, if you load the page in a web browser, you'll notice that the
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                element doesn't look like a link at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Yes, unfortunately, the
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                element on its own doesn't do much of anything.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Links</h1>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; gap: 1em">
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In the same way that an element adds meaning to the content it contains, an HTML
                    <em>attribute</em>
                    adds meaning to the element it's attached to.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Different elements allow different attributes, and you can refer to
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN</a>
                    for details about which elements accept which attributes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Right now, we're concerned with the
                    <code>href</code>
                    attribute because it determines where the user goes when they click an
                    <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                    element.
                  </li>
                  <li>Update your link to match the following:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre style="margin-bottom: 5em">
                  <code data-trim class="language-html">
                    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
                  </code>
                </pre>
              </div>
              <div>

            </div>
            <p>
              Notice how attributes live inside the opening tag. The attribute name comes first,
              then an equal sign, then the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the attribute in either single or double
              quotation marks. This syntax distinguishes attributes from content (which goes between
              the tags).

            <p>
              Absolute links are the most detailed way you can refer to a web resource. They start
              with the
              <strong>scheme</strong>
              (typically
              <code>http://</code>
              or
              <code>https://</code>
              ), followed by the
              <strong>domain name</strong>
              of the website, then the
              <strong>path of the target web page</strong>
              .

              class="background_white"
              src="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/root-relative-links-368060.237b8500.png"
              alt="Root-Relative Links"
            />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Root-relative links are similar to the previous section, but instead of being
                relative to the current page, they're relative to the
                <strong>root</strong>
                of the entire website.
              </li>
              <li>
                For instance, if your website is hosted on
                <code>our-site.com</code>
                , all root-relative URLs will be relative to
                <code>our-site.com</code>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                Unfortunately, there is one caveat to our discussion of root-relative links: we are
                using local HTML files instead of a website hosted on a web server. This means we
                <strong>won't be able to experiment with root-relative links</strong>
                . But, if we did have a real server, the link to our home page would look like this:
              </li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
              <code data-trim class="language-html">
                <script type="text/template">
                  <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->

                  <!-- The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former starts with a forward slash.  -->

                  <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
                </script>
              </code>
            </pre>
          </section>

            <h1>Link Targetes</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attributes alter the meaning of HTML elements, and sometimes you need to modify more
                than one aspect of an element.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example,
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                elements also accept a
                <code>target</code>
                attribute that defines where to display the page when the user clicks the link.
              </li>
              <li>
                By default, most browsers replace the current page with the new one. We can use the
                <code>target</code>
                attribute to ask the browser to open a link in a new window/tab.
              </li>
              <li>
                The
                <code>target</code>
                attribute has a few pre-defined values that carry special meaning for web browsers,
                but the most common one is
                <code>_blank</code>
                , which specifies a new tab or window. You can read about the rest on
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">MDN</a>

          <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You'll notice that none of our files or folders have
              <strong>spaces</strong>
              in their names. That's on purpose.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spaces</strong>
                  in URLs require special handling and should be avoided at all costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To see what we're talking about, try creating a new file in our
                  <code>links-and-images</code>
                  project called
                  <code>spaces are bad.html</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a little bit of text to it, then open it in Google Chrome or Safari (Firefox
                  cheats and preserves the spaces).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the address bar, you'll see that all our spaces have been replaced with
                  <code>%20</code>
                  :
                  <code>links-and-images/spaces%20are%20bad.html</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spaces aren't allowed in URLs, and that's the special encoding used to represent
                  them:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Instead of a space, you should always use a
                      <strong>hyphen</strong>
                      , as we've been doing throughout this tutorial.
                    </li>
                    <li>It's also a good idea to use all lowercase characters for consistency.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Notice how there's a direct connection between our
              <strong>file/folder names and the URL</strong>
              for the web page they represent.
              <ul>
                <li>The names of our folders and files determine the slugs for our web pages.</li>
                <li>
                  They're visible to the user, which means you should put in as much effort into
                  naming your files as you put into creating the content they contain.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Images are included in web pages with the
                <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>
                tag and its
                <code>src</code>
                attribute, which points to the image file you want to display.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notice how it's an empty element like
                <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>
                and
                <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                Retina displays and mobile devices make image handling a little bit more complicated
                than a plain old
                <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>
                tag. We'll deal with this later in the course.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also be sure to check out the
                <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>
                and
                <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>
                element in the
                <a href="/html-and-css/semantic-html/">Semantic HTML</a>
                chapter.

            <h1>Image Formats</h1>
            <p>
              There's four main image formats in use on the web, and they were all designed to do
              different things.
            </p>
            <img

              Understanding their intended purpose goes a long way towards improving the quality of
              your web pages.

            <ul>
              <li>
                JPG images are designed for handling
                <strong>large color palettes</strong>
                without exorbitantly increasing
                <strong>file size</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                This makes them great for
                <strong>photos</strong>
                and images with lots of
                <strong>gradients</strong>
                in them.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the other hand, JPGs don't allow for
                <strong>transparent</strong>
                pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you look real

            <h1>GIF Images</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                GIFs are the go-to option for simple
                <strong>animations</strong>
                , but the trade off is that they're somewhat
                <strong>limited in terms of color palette</strong>
                ‚Äînever use them for photos.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can't have
                <strong>semi-opaque</strong>
                pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent
                background.
              </li>
              <li>
                For this reason, it's usually better to use
                <strong>PNG</strong>
                images if you don't need animation.
              </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                PNGs are great for
                <strong>anything</strong>
                that's
                <strong>not a photo or animated</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                For
                <strong>photos</strong>
                , a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be
                bigger than an equivalent
                <strong>JPG</strong>
                file.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, they do deal with
                <strong>opacity</strong>
                just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations. This makes them an
                excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a
                <strong>vector-based</strong>
                graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to
                <em>any</em>
                dimension without loss of quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for
                <strong>responsive design</strong>
                . They're good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and
                <strong>you should use them whenever you can</strong>
                .

            <ul>
              <li>
                These 300x300 pixel images were originally 100x100 pixels, but scaling them up
                clearly shows the difference between them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notice the crisp, clean lines on the left SVG image, while the PNG image on the
                right is now very pixelated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite being a vector format, SVGs can be used exactly like their raster
                counterparts.

            <h1>Caveats</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across
                browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor
                (e.g.,
                <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>
                ).
              </li>
              <li>
                If your images contain a lot of text, this can have a big impact on file size.
              </li>
